## Game-Specific Stuff

### Pokemon FireRed Nuzlocke

Main rules:

- You can only catch the first Pokemon encountered in each area. If the Pokemon faints or escapes, then you can no longer catch a Pokemon in that area.
- If there are scripted battles or Shiny Pokemon encounters, then you can catch those Pokemon as well even if you already caught a Pokemon in that area.
- If there is a double battle, then you can only catch one of those Pokemon.
- Any Pokemon that you own that faints is considered dead. You must keep fainted pokemon in the Graveyard Box of the PC.

- You must give your Pokemon a nickname.
- If all your lineup faints, then that is considered as a Game Over.
- You can only use Pokemon that you captured. You cannot use Pokemon traded to you by another player. However, Pokemon that are obtained through in-game NPCs by trading or just getting them are allowed.
- No resets.

Optionnal rules:

- The Player ID (last digit) determines which Starter Pokemon you must choose. Numbers from 1 to 3 means you pick the Grass-type starter, 4 to 6 the Fire-type, 7 to 9 the Water-type, and 0 means you get to choose.
- If the first encounter in an area is a pokemon you already caught before or an evolution of said pokemon, you are allowed to catch the pokemon in the next encounter. (limited retry?)
- The use of Breeding and the Day Care Center is not allowed.
- You are not allowed to flee Random Battles.

- No Masterball?
- Limited use of each Pokecenter?
- Artwork of the pokemon caught
