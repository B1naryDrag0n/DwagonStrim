# Minecraft Server

I made an online Minecraft server! This server was created for me in regards to some game mechanics. What I was primarily looking for is a chill farming and building experience. To achieve this goal, I have selected a list of mods to run on the server. I also didn't wanna get bothered if I wanted to keep building at night, so monsters are disabled in the server settings (if anybody has a better solution to get rid of only monsters in the overworld, I could look into it).

## IMPORTANT --- RULES --- IMPORTANT

I want this server to be peaceful. In order to achieve that, here are the different rules:

1. Don't mess with stuff other people built on the server unless the player allowed you to.
2. Don't steal other people's stuff. Most people on the server will be happy to share and trade ressources if asked nicely. :3
3. Do not be rude to other players. <3

**If you can't follow these 3 simple rules, you will straight out be banned from the server!**

Not anybody can access the server, only whitelisted players can. In order to do so, I need your account UUID. If you wanna join the server, ya prolly know where to find me on Discord. ~UwU~

## Getting Started

Below is all you need in order to connect to the server.

### Minecraft Version

This server uses **Minecraft JAVA Edition** and runs on the version **1.20.1** of the game.

### Forge

**Forge** is the tool that is used to apply the mods to the game. Since quite a few mods also need to be installed client side, you need to install **Forge**. To be noted that you need the version of **Forge** that matches the version of Minecraft used (1.20.1).

Once **Forge** is installed on the client, you can then create a Forge 1.20.1 installation in the **Minecraft Launcher**.

### Graphics

If you have seen me screenshare Minecraft and you would like your game to have a similar look, you need to add [**Optifine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) (which is already included in the zipped mods folder available on this repo...you are welcome :3).

You then need to download [**Sildur's Vibrant Shaders**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/shaders/sildurs-vibrant-shaders) and put the downloaded zip file in the xxx folder of your Minecraft installation.

I also use better textures, which you can get [**here**](https://faithfulpack.net/downloads).

Also, if you wanna have the rainbow XP bar like I do, [**here it is**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/rainbow-xp-bar-and-ping).

### Mods

You can find a zipped **mods** folder HERE. The content of this folder has to go in the mods folder of your Minecraft installation.
